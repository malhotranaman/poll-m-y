# poll-m-y

An application designed to fill a void present in most people's lives. Too often, someone is excited upon completing a novel—whether it be a non-fiction masterpiece or a captivating work of fiction. In this surge of happiness, we often try to discuss the book with others—only to rarely find someone who has also read it, let alone recently.

Poll-m-y is an LLM-based application that serves as both a reading tracker and a reading 'buddy.' What does this mean? The 'buddy' aspect is customizable. You can configure attributes like country, background knowledge, and experience (such as skills and age) to create a virtual friend who can engage in discussions with you about the book you just read.
